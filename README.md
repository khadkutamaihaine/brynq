Orchestrate Claude, Gemini, GPT, Llama, and **2,600+ AI tools** from one platform. Your team brings their own AI subscriptions — Brynq makes them work together.

```
You: "Review this quarter's pipeline data and flag any deals at risk"

  Gemini:  Pulled Q1 data from Salesforce. 3 deals flagged: Acme Corp
           ($240K) missed last check-in, NovaTech ($180K) has no next
           steps logged, and Helios ($95K) pushed close date twice.

  Claude:  Cross-referencing with email threads and calendar: Acme's
           champion went on leave March 1. Recommend escalating to their
           VP. NovaTech's contract is with legal — likely stalled there,
           not lost. Helios is genuinely at risk.

  Llama:   ● Acme — escalate to VP (champion on leave)
           ● NovaTech — follow up with legal (not lost)
           ● Helios — at risk, needs intervention this week
```

## What Brynq does

### Multi-model orchestration
One prompt, multiple AI models working together. Brynq automatically picks the right strategy:

| Strategy | How it works | Best for |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Debate** | Two models argue, a third judges | Comparisons, decisions |
| **Refine** | One drafts, another critiques, first revises | Creative work, writing |
| **Fan-Out** | Models run in parallel, results merged | Research, analysis |
| **Sequential** | A→B→C with context passing | Multi-step workflows |
| **Single** | One model, direct response | Simple questions |

### 2,600+ marketplace tools
GitHub, Salesforce, Slack, databases, web search, document processing — install with one click, chain with any AI model.

```bash
brynq-runtime chain "pull my GitHub PRs, analyze with Claude, summarize with Llama"
```

### Bring your own keys (BYOK)
Use your team's existing Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT subscriptions. Add free local models via Ollama. No new vendor contracts.

### Privacy-first
All processing runs locally. Your documents, code, and data never touch our servers. Only orchestration metadata is shared.
