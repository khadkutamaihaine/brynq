```
You: "Analyze our Q1 pipeline and flag deals at risk"

  Gemini → Salesforce:  Pulled Q1 data. 3 deals flagged: Acme ($240K)
           missed check-in, NovaTech ($180K) stalled, Helios ($95K) slipping.

  Claude → Email+Cal:   Acme's champion went on leave March 1 — escalate
           to VP. NovaTech is with legal, not lost. Helios is genuine risk.

  Brynq:  Summary: 1 action (escalate Acme), 1 monitor (NovaTech),
          1 urgent (Helios needs intervention this week).
```

One prompt. Three models. Two data sources. Zero manual wiring.

## What Brynq does

### Multi-model orchestration
One prompt, multiple AI models working together. Brynq picks the right strategy automatically.

| Strategy | How it works | Best for |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Debate** | Models argue, a judge decides | Decisions, comparisons |
| **Refine** | Draft, critique, revise | Writing, analysis |
| **Fan-Out** | Models run in parallel, merge results | Research, data gathering |
| **Sequential** | A passes context to B to C | Multi-step workflows |
| **Swarm** | Up to 20 agents working in parallel | Large projects |

### 5,200+ tools, one marketplace
Connect to any API, database, or service. GitHub, Salesforce, Slack, Stripe, PostgreSQL, and thousands more. Install with one click or let Brynq auto-detect what you need.

```
You: "What are my open GitHub PRs?"

  Brynq:  [Auto-installed: GitHub]
          You have 3 open PRs...
```

### Universal protocol support
Point Brynq at any endpoint. It figures out the protocol and connects.

- **REST APIs** — any OpenAPI/Swagger spec
- **GraphQL** — introspection-based discovery
- **SQL** — PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
- **MCP** — Model Context Protocol servers
- **gRPC** — service reflection
- **WebSocket** — real-time streams

### Persistent memory
Brynq remembers across conversations. Project context, past decisions, and outcomes feed into every response. The more you use it, the better it gets.

### Privacy-first
All execution runs locally. Your documents, code, and data never touch our servers. API keys stay in your encrypted vault. Only orchestration metadata is shared.
